Notes from help with Phillippe

-Can use JS to calculate the width of the screen

-creating a lot of obstacles so you can't use variables

-Use a constructor function to create obstacles

-Build obstacles with constructor function, pass a speed so that the obstacle travels toward the player

-Can test it in the console

Today- create the obstacle

Tomorrow- create the player 

-------------------

Steps to get this work done: 

1. Link JS and CSS files
2. Create an obstacle using a variable
3. Create a constructor function 
4. Think about how the obstacle is moving across the screen
5. Create divs that measure where the obstacle needs to be in order to get the skiier to jump over it.
