###Description of the game:

In this 1991 Microsoft classic, you are a skier who is trying to avoid obstacles on the ski slope. 

 I am making a simpler version where the obstacles come toward the skier and the skier must move left or right at the right time to avoid the obstacle.

####How to Play: 

Click start and move your skier left and right to avoid obstacles. After you crash, it is player 2's turn. 

The winner is the skier who has avoided obstacles for longer.
