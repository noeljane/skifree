#Ski Free
--

###Description of the game:

In this 1991 Microsoft classic, you are a skier who is trying to avoid obstacles and getting eaten by ogres. 

Since I'm a baby coder, I am making a much simpler version where the obstacles come toward the skiier and the skier must jump at the right time to avoid the obstacle.

I want to hit start to begin play

I want to control my guy using a click

####MVP:

- guy has random objects coming near him 
- objects randomly appear from the left of the screen
- when guy hits object, he loses points or health
- player 2 can play and score is compared to player 1

Stuff I already think I can figure out:

Stuff I need help with: 
- how to make guy run into object 
- how to control a guy that is moving downhill constantly without making him stop moving

Pseudocode to probably move to JS file: 

Can use JS to calculate the width of the screen

creating a lot of obstacles so you can't use variables

Use a constructor function to create obstacles

Build obstacles with constructor function, pass a speed so that the obstacle travels toward the player

Can test it in the console

Today- create the obstacle

Tomorrow- create the player
