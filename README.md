#Ski Free

###Description of the game:

In this 1991 Microsoft classic, you are a skier who is trying to avoid obstacles and getting eaten by ogres. 

Since I'm a baby coder, I am making a much simpler version where the obstacles come toward the skiier and the skier must jump at the right time to avoid the obstacle.
